# Markdown-File-Viewer
<hr/>
This is a Python-based program that allows users to view Markdown files offline. The program features a user-friendly interface that includes an open file button and a live preview button that generates a live preview of the Markdown file. The program uses the Python-Markdown library to convert the Markdown syntax to HTML, which is displayed in a PyQt5 WebEngineView widget. This allows users to see how the Markdown file will look when rendered as HTML.
